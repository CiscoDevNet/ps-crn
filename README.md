# Public Sector Cloud Ready Network



## Background

Public sector IT departments are challenged with the complexity of managing the performance of an increasing number of
dynamic workloads and cloud-based applications in the most secure manner possible. To make changes in the wide area
network (WAN) on the fly to address increased usage or improve performance, you need a software-defined WAN (SD-WAN)
solution that is built on automation and that simplifies management.  The Public Sector Cloud Ready Network provides the following:

* Segmentation: Topology-driven network-wide segmentation
* Service Chaining: Insertion of security services into the traffic flow, including firewalls, IDS, as well as third-party solutions.
* End-to-End Encryption: Secure, zero-trust, authenticated transport, the ability to extend the SD-WAN encrypted fabric into public cloud providers (such as AWS and Azure) by automatically instantiating virtual SD-WAN endpoints in the enterprise customer’s cloud region.
* Application Aware Routing: Intelligent traffic steering based on application awareness of the application’s locations (on-premise, public cloud like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, or SaaS) and SLA requirements needed over a specific WAN link, including application brownout mitigation.
* High-Availability: East/West COLO presence for geographic load-balancing and redundancy
* Transport independence: Major cost reduction relating to WAN, including circuit cost, operational expenditure, and the ability to leverage lower-cost bandwidth services, through transport optimization.
* Analytics: Advanced analytics for both real-time insight to the WAN fabric’s behavior, as well as future-looking “what-if” analysis for billing, capacity planning, all cloud managed.

## Objective

This repo provides the following:

* A [Architecture](docs/Architecture.md)
* A [VIRL Topology](docs/virl/virl.md#topology) to simulate the Validated Design
* [Automated Tooling](docs/Automation.md) to deploy and test the Validated Design
* DevNet Learning Labs to help learn the automated tooling for the Validated Design
